E-Commerce Payment Service
This repository contains the implementation of the Payment Service for the E-Commerce application.
Overview
The Payment Service is responsible for processing payments, managing refunds, and tracking payment history for the e-commerce platform. It follows a RESTful API design and is part of a microservices architecture.

Features:
Process payments using different payment methods (credit card, PayPal, etc.)
Retrieve payment information by ID
Retrieve all payments for a specific order
Process refunds
Integration with payment gateways (simulated)
Integration with other services (Order Service)
Notification system for payment events

Technology Stack
Framework: Spring Boot 3.1.5
Database: MySQL (configurable, can use H2 for development)
Build Tool: Maven
Java Version: 17
Documentation: OpenAPI (Swagger)

REST Principles Implementation
The Payment Service follows REST principles:
Resource-Based: The API is designed around resources (payments) with clear URIs
HTTP Methods: Uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, DELETE) for operations
Stateless: Each request contains all the information needed to complete the request
JSON Format: Uses JSON for data exchange
HATEOAS: Includes links to related resources (partially implemented)
Status Codes: Uses appropriate HTTP status codes for responses
Idempotent Operations: GET and DELETE operations are idempotent

Quality Attributes:
Security:
Data masking for sensitive payment information (PCI compliance)
Input validation
Exception handling to prevent information leakage

Performance:
Connection pooling for database access
Timeout configurations for external service calls

Scalability:
Stateless design enables horizontal scaling
Cloud-native ready for deployment on cloud platforms

Reliability:
Comprehensive error handling
Transaction management
Logging for troubleshooting

Setup and Running:
Prerequisites:
Java 17+
Maven
MySQL (or use H2 for development)

Configuration:
Edit application.yml to configure:
Database connection
Server port
Logging settings

Build and Run
bashCopy# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>

# Navigate to the project directory
cd payment-service

# Build the project
mvn clean package

# Run the application
java -jar target/payment-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
Running with Docker
bashCopy# Build Docker image
docker build -t ecommerce/payment-service .

# Run Docker container
docker run -p 8082:8082 ecommerce/payment-service
Testing
The service includes both unit tests and integration tests:
bashCopy# Run all tests
mvn test

# Run specific test class
mvn test -Dtest=PaymentServiceImplTest
Testing with Postman
A Postman collection is available to test the API endpoints.

Front-End Integration
Simple HTML forms are provided for testing:
/payment-form.html - Process a new payment
/payment-lookup.html - Look up payment details
/payment-refund.html - Process a refund

Cloud Deployment
The service is designed to be deployed to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS):
Dockerfile for containerization
Stateless design for horizontal scaling
Configuration externalization
